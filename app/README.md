## 🏗️ Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Client (Browser)] -- face-api.js --> B[FastAPI Server]
    B -- SQLAlchemy ORM --> C[SQLite Database]
```

- **Client:**  
    Built with HTML/CSS/JS and `face-api.js` models for face detection.  
    Periodically sends monitoring events to the FastAPI backend.

- **Backend:**  
    FastAPI for RESTful API endpoints.  
    SQLAlchemy models for User, Exam, FaceLog, TabEvent, etc.  
    Role-based access control via JWT or cookie-based authentication.

- **Database:**  
    SQLite3 by default (configurable for Postgres/MySQL).
